# Dog Breed Detector

This mobile application combines React Native and machine learning to build an Dog Breed Detector.

On the Dog Breed Detector App, the user can either upload or take a picture of their dog and the app will report what breed the dog belongs to.

The app has been created for both Android and IOS.
